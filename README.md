javascript trivia game

# Technologies Used: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Approach Taken: 
I had an immediate vision for the design/layout so I did that first and focused on the Javascript after that. I initially was going to put all the questions on one page but it would be a lot less cluttered if I cycled through the questions. 

My initial goals were:

1. Create the template for the quiz with HTML/CSS
2. Get the text from the first set of questions/answers in the template with Javascript
3. Check the selected answer against the actual answer and alert if it's correct or incorrect
4. Change questions/answers once the selected answer is checked

Once I finished those, I ended up adjusting styling, changing content, adding a counter and removing the alert by allowing the counter to display if the selected answer was wrong. 

# Installation Instructions: 
None? 

# Unsolved problems: 
There aren't any problems with the submitted project. However, I wanted to add a "Try Again" button at the end that takes the user back to the beginning but it wasn't working out.
